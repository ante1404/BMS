# BMS
Welcome to my Bank Management System! This project is written in custom Tkinter to make a GUI, using the Subprocess library in Python to call various C programs that handle data manipulation such as account creation, credit card creation, Storing data to hashmap, saving and loading the hashmap, and much more.

I am aware that it is crucial to add error handling to both Python and C programs to ensure that the program runs smoothly without any issues. Therefore, I will implement error handling to make sure that the program can handle unexpected situations and avoid any crashes or data loss.

Additionally, I understand that code readability is essential for future maintenance and scaling of the project. Therefore, I plan to refactor some Python code to make it more readable and easier to understand and also document and comment along the way.

My next goal is to add more features to this project, such as deleting accounts, and loans, and encrypting the data to add a level of security to the bank's sensitive information and expand the profile to contain more data and features.

The primary objective of this project was to implement a working app that helps in managing bank accounts and data effectively. I hope that you find this project interesting as it was my first project ever. I know I could have done everything in one language, but that was not my goal. I wanted to complicate things to get more knowledge from both Python and C and try to combine them and their libraries. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.
